# react-native-boilerplate-kit

This little project is my humble attempt to make Cross-platform reusable Components and other resourses to head-start new React Native project.

## Watch out the bugs

This code is still messy!


## Building and contributing

If you want to check the code yourself, make some changes or add something to it you are more then welcome!
You need to have react-native scripts installed
clone the repo and run:

```
yarn install
```

or

```
npm install
```

Here are the scripts:


`npm run ios` - run the native react ios app in iOS Simulator

`npm run android` - run the native react android app in android Simulator

`npm run doctor` - troubleshooting and automatically fixing errors with your development environment
