# react-native-boilerplate-kit

This little project is my humble attempt to make Cross-platform reusable Components and other resourses to head-start new React Native project.


## Building and contributing

If you want to check the code yourself, make some changes or add something to it you are more then welcome!
You need to have react-native scripts installed
clone the repo and run:

```
yarn install
```

or

```
npm install
```

Here are the scripts:


`react-native run-ios` - run the native react ios app in iOS Simulator

`react-native run-android` - run the native react android app in android Simulator
